Built with PHP and HTML/CSS in a Laravel framework, FutureBound is a web app that offers a comprehensive list of scholarships, enabling high school students to locate and apply for scholarships. Scholarship information is stored in a database with MYSQL. It allows users to add scholarships through a form where contents are emailed to admins. Users can also filter scholarships by name, tags, and deadline dates.
